0. Data Sourcing
1. Data Cleaning
    - Cast to correct types
    - Handing missing values / outliers
2. Data Processing
    - Scaling (Normalization)
    - standardization
    - Lowers categorical variables
3. Feature Engineering
    - Adding novel features from existing or other sources
    - Extracting additional information from existing sources
    - Eg: combining, cutting grouping, clustering, extracting, etc.
4. Feature Selection
    - Balancing predictive power & computational costs with information loss
    - Drop correlated features
    - Keep "important" features
5. Splitting new dataset
    - train-test set
    - train-validate-test
    - n-fold cross-validation
6. Train Model
    - Fit model based on data
7. Validation / Tune Hyperparameters
    - Estimate how well will the the model generalize
8. Test
9. Deploy
